### Cuboid mesh add-on for Blender 2.83

### About

Well, this little experiment turned out ok. It calculates verts and faces for a cuboid of custom dimensions and resolution. Building on my initial script, I have tidied up the code, added a new feature and moved all functions in one, self-contained, reusable class. 

### Installation

- Download the .zip archive to your hard drive 
- Start Blender and open the Preferences window from the Edit menu
- In the Add-ons tab, click Install... and select the downloaded .zip file
- Enable the add-on

### Use

Once enabled, the 'Add Cuboid' operator may be accessed in 'Object Mode', from the '3D Viewport' either by
- the Operator search (F3 key), or
- the Add>Mesh menu

There are three sets of (X/Y/Z) parameters for Radius (Size), Resolution (number of Segments) and Tone (factoring the spread/size of segments).
Additionally, there is an option for viewing the new object's wireframe.

I hope it helps!
